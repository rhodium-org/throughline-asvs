# OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 — throughline source

This document is **generated from the graph** by `tl docs`; `tl docs --check` gates
it in CI. The prose headings are hand-owned — everything between `tl:*` markers is
injected from the YAML items, so the published spec can never drift from the graph.

This source is a faithful, complete cut of **OWASP ASVS v4.0.3**: every chapter is a
`user_requirement`, and every non-retired verification requirement is a
`system_requirement` that `implements` its chapter. The published ASVS number lives in
`attrs.source_ref` (e.g. `V2.1.1`); the ASVS level in `attrs.level`. The throughline
UIDs are this source's own and immutable — a consumer cites a clause as `asvs:SR-0003`,
never by its ASVS number.

It carries
<!-- tl:count type == 'user_requirement' -->
14
<!-- tl:end --> chapters and
<!-- tl:count type == 'system_requirement' -->
278
<!-- tl:end --> verification requirements. (ASVS clauses retired as
`[DELETED]` in 4.0.3 carry no level and are intentionally omitted.)

## Purpose

<!-- tl:item INT-0001 -->
**INT-0001 — An application's security is verifiable against a graded, testable baseline** — `intent`, status `approved`

> The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard exists so that an application's security controls can be verified against a normative, level-graded set of requirements — giving developers, testers and procurers a shared baseline rather than ad-hoc judgement.
